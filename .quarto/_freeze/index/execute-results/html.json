This is a TASO resource site. Access the [main TASO website here](https://taso.org.uk/). This website contains:\n\n-   [**Data visualisation style guide**](data-vis/index.qmd): Developed to help TASO, our partners, and the wider sector to create impactful charts. Designed to provide clear, accessible guidelines that you can apply using the data visualisation tool of your choice (e.g., Excel, R or Tableau).\n\n-   [**Coding good practice**](coding-good-practice/index.qmd): Guidelines, tools and tips for ensuring that code is accessible and shareable. Designed for those looking to improve the tidiness, reproducibility and quality of their R scripts.\n\n-   [**Contact point**](contact.qmd): We view these guides as iterative resources, and we encourage you to share your feedback.\n\n## Why publish on GitHub?\n\nWe created these documents using Quarto, and published them through GitHub. This enables a more fluid and responsive approach to sharing good practices. It allows us to regularly update the content, ensuring that you always have access to the latest guidelines in data visualisation and coding.\n\nThe interactive nature of this website also facilitates a more engaging experience. You will see callout boxes that highlight key points or warnings:\n\n::: callout-tip\nThe data visualisation guide and coding good practice are separate but complementary documents. We designed the data visualisation style guide with a wide audience in mind. Those who do code can view the technical details behind the charts.\n:::\n\nYou will also see when we are referring to code through text highlighted `like this`. You can see code that you can copy and try yourself in these fold-out boxes:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\ntaso_three_colour <- c(\"#3b66bc\", \"#00a8da\", \"#07dbb3\")\n\ndf <- data.frame(\n  Year = c(2019, 2020, 2021, 2022),\n  School_A = c(10, 12, 15, 13),\n  School_B = c(17, 15, 21, 24),\n  School_C = c(4, 2, 5, 6)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou can see the latest changes and the code behind how we built this website using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/taso-he).\n\n::: callout-note\n**The TASO Technical Guide Â© 2024 by TASO is licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

While the specific content from the guide has not been used, [the code structure](https://github.com/royal-statistical-society/datavisguide/blob/main/_quarto.yml) has been valuable in the development of specific functionalities on this site.
