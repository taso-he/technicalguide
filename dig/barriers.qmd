## Barriers to effective evaluation

@tbl-barriers presents an overview of the barriers to effective evaluation. Key challenges include data inconsistencies, fragmented infrastructure, and a lack of alignment between institutional goals and evaluation processes. These barriers hinder the ability to gather, interpret, and utilise data effectively. These issues contribute to difficulties in maintaining consistent and accurate evaluation practices.

: Barriers to effective evaluation {#tbl-barriers .striped .hover}

## Facilitators of effective evaluation

In contrast to @tbl-barriers, @tbl-facilitators highlights best practices that can support institutions in overcoming these challenges. These facilitators include centralised access to data, consistent systems for recording post-entry interventions, and the establishment of clear ethical guidelines for data analysis. Tools like learning analytics systems and \\ data dashboard with sufficient granularity can help identify and address equality gaps. A shared understanding of data, coupled with dedicated ethics processes and privacy notices, can improve the effectiveness of evaluation.
