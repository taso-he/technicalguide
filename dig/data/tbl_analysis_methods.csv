Method,Purpose,Focus,Example
Descriptive statistics,Summarise and describe the basic features of the dataset.,"Averages (mean, median, mode), variability (standard deviation, range).","Students from deprived areas (IMD quintiles 1 and 2) score X% on average, while their peers who are not from deprived areas (IMD quintiles 3-5) score Y% on average."
T-test,Compare means between two groups.,Assess if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two groups.,Is there a statistically significant different between the attainment of two groups?; e.g. comparing the attainment of students from IMD quintiles 1 and 2 with the attainment of students from IMD quintiles 3-5.
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA),Compare means across multiple groups.,Determine if there are statistically significant mean differences across three or more groups.,Is there a statistically significant difference in attainment across more than two groups?; e.g. comparing the score of students by their highest previous qualification (Below A Level vs A Level vs higher education qualification). 
Regression,Explore relationships between variables and predict outcomes.,"Identify the impact of predictor variables on an outcome variable while controlling for variability due to other factors, assess the strength and direction of relationships, and make predictions based on the model.",Is there a statistically significant effect of socio-economic status and gender on attainment when controlling for prior attainment and course studied?
