Method,Purpose,Focus,Example
Descriptive statistics,Summarise and describe the basic features of the dataset.,"Averages (mean, median, mode), variability (standard deviation, range).","Disadvantaged students score X% on average, while their more advantaged peers score Y% on average."
T-test,Compare means between two groups.,Assess if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two groups.,Is there a statistically significant different between the attainment of two groups?; e.g. comparing the attainment of disadvantaged students with the attainment of more advantaged students students.
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA),Compare means across multiple groups.,Determine if there are statistically significant mean differences across three or more groups.,Is there a statistically significant difference in attainment across more than two groups?; e.g. comparing the score of students by their highest previous qualification (Below A Level vs A Level vs higher education qualification). Note: If the ANOVA revealed a significant difference
Regression,Explore relationships between variables and predict outcomes.,"Identify the impact of predictor variables on an outcome variable while controlling for variability due to other factors, assess the strength and direction of relationships, and make predictions based on the model.",Is there a statistically significant effect of disadvantage and gender on attainment when controlling for prior attainment and course studied?
