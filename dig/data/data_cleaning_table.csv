Process,Explanation,Example 
Remove duplicates,"Identify and remove duplicate rows, as they can lead to inaccurate analysis and skewed results. ","In a dataset of student records, duplicate entries with the same student ID and name could be removed "
Standardise formats,"Ensure that data formats are consistent across the dataset, such as date formats, capitalisation, units of measurement.","Student IMD deprivations may be recorded as deciles (1, 2, 3 etc.), bands (0-10%, 11-20% etc.) or as a binary (deprived, not deprived)."
Check for validity ,"Validate the data to ensure that values fall within expected ranges or conform to specific rules or patterns. For categorical variables, check that upper and lower case letters, white space, and spellings are consistent.","In a dataset of grades, value outside the expected range of 0-100 could be flagged as invalid. For course name 'economics', 'economics ' and 'Econ' might need correcting to a standard form 'Economics' "
Merge or split columns ,"If necessary, merge or split columns to better represent the data. ","Module name and code may be best split over multiple columns, e.g. ""BEE1010Econometrics"" may be best split into ""Module code"" (BEE1010) and ""Module name"" (Econometrics)"
Document the process,"Maintain a record of the data cleaning steps taken, including any assumptions or decisions made, to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Keep a copy of the raw data before cleaning.  ","Create a document that outlines how invalid grades were dealt with, or how missing IMD data was treated"
