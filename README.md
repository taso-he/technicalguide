# TASO Technical Guide

This GitHub repository contains the files and code for the TASO Technical Guide.

## How we built the guide

This project builds a website using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and is hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This enables a more fluid and responsive approach to sharing good practices. It allows us to regularly update the content, ensuring that you always have access to the latest guidelines in data visualisation and coding. The interactive nature of the website also facilitates a more engaging experience.
