## Introduction

Welcome to the TASO Interactive Technical Guides, a collection of interactive resources designed to guide and enhance your evaluation, data visualisation and coding practices. This website contains:

## Why publish on GitHub?

We created these documents using Quarto, and published them through GitHub. This enables a more fluid and responsive approach to sharing good practices. It allows us to regularly update the content, ensuring that you always have access to the latest guidance.

The interactive nature of this website also facilitates a more engaging experience. You will see callout boxes that highlight key points or warnings:

::: callout-tip
The data visualisation guide and coding good practice are separate but complementary documents. We designed the data visualisation style guide with a wide audience in mind. Those who do code can view the technical details behind the charts.
:::

You will also see when we are referring to code through text highlighted `like this`. You can see code that you can copy and try yourself in these fold-out boxes:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

taso_three_colour <- c("#3b66bc", "#00a8da", "#07dbb3")

df <- data.frame(
  Year = c(2019, 2020, 2021, 2022),
  School_A = c(10, 12, 15, 13),
  School_B = c(17, 15, 21, 24),
  School_C = c(4, 2, 5, 6)
)
```

You can see the latest changes and the code behind how we built this website using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/taso-he/technicalguide).
